# AdTech Mastery Quiz - Project Report

**Project Title**: AdTech Mastery Quiz
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: January 29, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary
The **AdTech Mastery Quiz** is a premium, gamified educational platform designed to help professionals and students master the complex ecosystem of Digital Advertising Technology. Unlike standard quiz applications, it offers a high-fidelity, immersive user experience ("Glassmorphism" aesthetic) combined with advanced learning tools like scenario-based reasoning ("Mastermind Mode") and persistent performance analytics ("Pro Stats Dashboard").

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Pro Stats Dashboard
*   **Visual Analytics**: Users can track their progress through a "Spider Chart" (Radar Chart) visualizing 5 key attributes: Knowledge, Speed, Experience, Tenacity, and Focus.
*   **Persistent History**: Utilizes a custom LocalStorage service to save every quiz attempt, allowing users to review past scores and improvement over time.
*   **Detailed Metrics**: Displays Average Score, Best Streak, and Total Time Spent.

### 2.2 Mastermind Mode (Insight Engine 2.0)
*   **Scenario-Based Learning**: A flagship feature that presents complex, real-world AdTech scenarios rather than simple multiple-choice questions.
*   **Deep Reasoning**: Users must apply multi-step logic to solve problems (e.g., debugging a waterfall setup or optimizing a bid strategy).
*   **Instant Feedback**: Provides detailed, context-aware explanations for every decision.

### 2.3 Comprehensive Content Library
*   **Scale**: Over **250+ questions** covering 11 distinct chapters.
*   **Topics**: Ranges from "Basics" and "Programmatic" to advanced "Identity Resolution", "Attribution Models", and "Privacy Sandbox".
*   **Randomization**: Smart shuffling algorithms ensure no two sessions are identical.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Core Stack
*   **Framework**: **React 19** - Utilizing the latest Concurrent features and hooks for optimized rendering.
*   **Build Tool**: **Vite 7.2** - Ensures lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized production builds.
*   **Language**: **TypeScript** - Enforcing strict type safety across the application to prevent runtime errors.

### 3.2 Styling & Design System
*   **Tailwind CSS 3.4**: A utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI development.
*   **Tailwind Merge (twMerge)**: Utility for efficiently resolving Tailwind class conflicts, essential for dynamic component styling.
*   **Lucide React**: A modern, lightweight icon library providing consistent visual language.
*   **Glassmorphism**: A core design philosophy using backdrop filters (`backdrop-blur-xl`), semi-transparent gradients, and subtle borders to create depth and hierarchy.

### 3.3 State Management & Animation
*   **Framer Motion 12**: Powering complex animations, including:
    *   Page transitions (AnimatePresence)
    *   Hover effects (Scale, Glow)
    *   Statistical charts (Animated SVG paths for the Radar Chart)
*   **React Hooks**: Extensive use of `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for game logic state.
*   **LocalStorage Service**: A focused service layer (`src/services/storage.ts`) handling data persistence, ensuring user progress survives page reloads.

### 3.4 Project Structure
```

├── components/       # Reusable UI components (QuizCard, StatsDashboard, etc.)
├── data/            # Static JSON data (questions.json, insight-loops.json)
├── services/        # Business logic & external communication (storage.ts, api.ts)
├── App.tsx          # Main application controller & router
└── index.css        # Global styles & Tailwind directives
```

## 4. Design Techniques

### 4.1 Immersive UI
The application moves away from "flat" design towards a rich, layered interface.
*   **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Uses `MouseParallax` to create a subtle depth effect that responds to cursor movement.
*   **Interactive Gradients**: Buttons and cards feature "moving" gradients on hover to signal interactivity.
*   **Sonic Feedback**: Integrated sound effects (via `use-sound` pattern) for clicks, success, and error states (placeholder architecture ready).

### 4.2 Responsive & Accessible
*   **Mobile-First**: All layouts, including the complex Stats Dashboard, are fully responsive, stacking vertically on mobile devices utilizing Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`).
*   **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper button and heading tags to ensure basic screen reader compatibility.

## 5. Future Roadmap
*   **Backend Integration**: Migrating from LocalStorage to a real database (PostgreSQL/NestJS) for global leaderboards.
*   **Mobile App**: Wrapping the web app into a native container (React Native or Capacitor).
*   **AI Tutor**: Expanding Mastermind Mode with a real-time LLM chat interface for deeper explanations.
